# Discord-Tokentool
Short understandable Discord Token Tool without to much features you dont need =)

This simple Scripts are here to show you your Discord Tokens.

The `token_print.py` script only shows all locally stored tokens to you.

The `token_webhook.py` script sends the token to a webhook you must enter before executing.
