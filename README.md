# Discord-Tokengrabber
Short understandable Tokengrabber without to much features you dont need =)

This simple Scripts are here to show you your Discord Tokens (not others).\n

The `sirox_tokenshower.py` script only shows all locally stored tokens to you.

The `sirox_tokengrabber.py` script sends the token to a webhook you must enter before executing.
